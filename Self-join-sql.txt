Self-join:
----------
Joining the same table multiple times is known as Self-join
we use self-join whenever we need to differentiate the values which are present in a same column
Syntax:	ANSI:
	select (referencecolName based on clause)
	from tab1 t1 join tab1 t2
	on t1.relationalcol=t2.relationalcol;

	ORACLE:
	select (reference based on clause)
	from tab1 t1, tab2 t2
	on t1.relationcol=t2.relationcol;
Note:
----
since we are joining the same table to differentiate the tables using reference is mandatory.
whenever we need to access the col within self-join we should take the reference of a table.
Ref.columnName.
In self-join join condition means relating columns which are present within the same table
ex: In emp table
    empno-Mgr
1)WAQTD all the employee name along with their manager name?
	select e1.ename,e1.job,e2.ename,e2.job
	from emp e1 join emp e2
	on e1.empno=e2.mgr;
2)WAQTD employee name employees job his manager name and managers job?
	select e1.ename,e1.job,e2.ename,e2.job
	from emp e1 join emp e2
	on e1.empno=e2.mgr;
3)WAQTD Manager name and their ename of the managers whose name is KING,FORD,JONES?
	select e1.ename,e2.ename
	from emp e1 join emp e2
	on e1.empno=e2.mgr
	and e1.ename in('KING','FORD','JONES');
4)WAQTD ename,employees location and his manager name?

	select e1.ename,loc,e2.ename
	from emp e1,dept,emp e2
	where e1.deptno=dept.deptno and
	e1.mgr=e2.empno;
	ANSI syntax:
	------------
	select e1.ename,loc,e2.ename
	from emp e1 join dept
	on e1.deptno=dept.deptno
	join emp e2
	on e1.mgr=e2.emp;
5)WAQTD employee name employees deptname his manager name and managers location?
select e1.ename,d1.dname,e2.ename,d2.job
from emp e1,dept d1,emp e2,dept d2
where emp e1.deptno=dept.deptno and 
e2.deptno=d2.deptno and
e1.mgr=e

Key Attributes:
---------------
Attributes which identifies 
key attributes are also known as prime key attributes

Non-prime Key Attributes:
-------------------------
Attributes which cannot identify the records uniquely is known as non-prime key attributes.
types of key attributes:

1)Super key
2)Composite Key
3)Candidate Key
4)Primary Key
5)Alternate key
6)Foreign Key

Super Key: A single attribute or a group of attributes which identifies the record uniquickly is known as super key
----------
	sId  | sName  |  C.no  |  Course  |  yop
       --------------------------------------------
	1    | A      |  9....0|   JFS    |  2023
	2    | B      |  78...0|   MS     |  2024
	3    | C      |  68...9|   JFS    |  2022
	4    | D      |  70...8|   DevOps |  2023
	5    | E      |  630..9|   AT     |  2022
Example:- columns
	stid,email,Sname,C.no

Composite key: only a group of attributes which identifies the record uniquely are known as Composite Key.
--------------	eg: sName,c.no
Candidate Key: Only a single attribute which identifies the records uniquely is known as Candidate key.
--------------  eg: S_id, email
Primary Key: A unique identifiying attribute in a table is known as Primary Key.
------------ Primary key is always generated by main users
		eg: S_id
Alternate Key: Except primary key all the other uniwue identifying attributes are considered as alternate key.
--------------  eg: email,Sname,c.no
Foreign Key: Parent table primary key column will be ready to identify the records inside child table as a foreign key.
------------	eg: 

Normalization:
--------------
The process of spliting up of one larger table into multiple smaller table is known as Normalization
advantages of normalization:
--avoids data redundancy
Data redundancy: Inserting same values for multiple columns symultaneously is known as data redundancy.
--reduces the complexity of the table
--avoids Data Anamely
Data Anamely: An interuption occuring while performing DML tasks is known as Data Anamely.
Insertion Anamely: Interuption occuring while inserting the valuesis known as Insertion Anamely.
Updation Anamely: An Interruption occuring while updating the data is known as Updation Anamely.
Deletion Anamely: An Interruption occuring while deleting the values is known as Deletion Anamley.
--Maintainces Data accuracy.
